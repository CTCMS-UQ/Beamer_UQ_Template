UQ template for Beamer.

To use, clone this repository and just build your presentation in `main.tex`.
Running `make` should build everything (possibly with some edits to fit your
system/preferred LaTeX compiler).

TODO
----
  * Test colours etc. for anything not yet covered by the example in `main.tex` (eg. captions)
  * Fix indentation of subitems and subsubitems
  * Add image template for 'folded corner' outline (eg. for group photos on thank you page)
  * Add (optional?) graphic to title page
