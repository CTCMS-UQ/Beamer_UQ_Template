UQ template for Beamer.

To use, clone this repository and just write your presentation in `main.tex`.

```git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/CTCMS-UQ/Beamer_UQ_Template.git```

Running `make` should build everything (although you may need some edits to fit
your system/preferred LaTeX compiler).

TODO
----
  * Test colours etc. for anything not yet covered by the example in `main.tex` (eg. captions)
  * Reduce indentation of subitems and subsubitems
  * Add image template for 'folded corner' outline (eg. for group photos on thank you page)
  * Add (optional?) graphic to title page
  * Make page numbers white on `[standout]` frames.
